  The life cycle of genome builds spans interlocking pillars
  of assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics to drive
  biological insights. The JCVI library is a versatile
  Python-based library that offers a suite of tools that
  excel across these pillars. Featuring a modular design,
  the JCVI library provides high-level utilities for tasks
  such as format parsing, graphics generation, and
  manipulation of genome assemblies and annotations.
  Supporting genomics algorithms like MCscan and ALLMAPS are
  widely employed in building genome releases, producing
  publication-ready figures for quality assessment and
  evolutionary inference.
